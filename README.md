<h2> WorkTime - Laravel Application </h2>

This is my first application in Laravel.

Simple and very basic service build just for the engineer thesis defence at college.

Features:
<ul>
<li> Start / stop work </li>
<li> Start / stop break </li>
<li> Display calendar </li>
<li> CRUD events within calendar </li>
<li> TODO list synchronized with calendar </li>

</ul>
